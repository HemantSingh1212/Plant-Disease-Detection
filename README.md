# Plant-Disease-Detection

Plant Disease Detection project to detect the diseases in the plants by scanning the images of the leaves and then passing to through the neural network to detect wether the plant is infected or not. 

For this we are planning to develop an flutter app and a web-app, from where the users can upload the image of the leaves and get them detected. 

The images will be sent to a remote cloud sever where the neural network will detect the disease and then will return the result.
